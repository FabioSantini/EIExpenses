## Key Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Path Items (Must Complete in Order):
1. **Foundation Setup** → Data Abstractions → Frontend Core → OCR Integration → Azure Integration → Testing
2. **Data Service Interface** must be complete before both Mock and Azure implementations
3. **Core UI Components** must be ready before OCR and Export features
4. **Azure Infrastructure** must be provisioned before production data services

### External Dependencies:
- **OpenAI API Key** (required for OCR processing)
- **Azure Subscription** (required for production deployment)
- **Google Maps API** (if implementing fuel expense location features)

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Mock services enable parallel development** - Frontend team can work independently
- **Interface abstractions** allow easy switching between mock/production
- **Incremental deployment** - Can deploy without OCR initially
- **Feature flags** - Can enable/disable features during development

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Gates:
1. **Foundation**: Project builds, lints, and deploys successfully
2. **Data Layer**: All CRUD operations work with mock data
3. **Frontend**: Full expense workflow functional with mock backend
4. **OCR**: Receipt processing extracts data with >80% accuracy
5. **Export**: Excel files generated with attached receipts
6. **Azure**: Production deployment with real data persistence
7. **Testing**: >85% code coverage, all E2E scenarios pass

### Final Acceptance:
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface working on iOS/Android browsers
- [ ] Receipt photo capture and OCR processing functional
- [ ] Excel export with attached receipts working
- [ ] User authentication and data isolation working
- [ ] Production deployment stable and monitored
- [ ] All P0 and P1 tasks completed
